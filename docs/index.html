      <h3>What is AI?</h3>
When you enter the letters AI into the dictionary it tells you that AI is a three toed sloth. But of course, that’s not what this 
blog is about, nonetheless this shows us that AI (acronym for artificial intelligence) is still very new. Yet this is not entirely 
true, the term artificial intelligence was coined 1956 by the Stanford professor John McCarthy. He defined AI as: “the science and
engineering of making intelligent machines.” This definition is still accurate today, we understand under artificial intelligence
computer systems that can perform tasks that would require human intelligence. It involves the creation of intelligent machines 
which can sense their environment, learn from experience, and make decisions or take actions to achieve particular goals. 
AI systems are designed to analyze large amounts of data, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights. They can learn from 
these patterns and experiences to improve their performance over time.

<h3>How does AI work?</h3>
To put it simple, artificial intelligence works by combining large data sets with intuitive processing algorithms. 
AI can manipulate those algorithms by learning patterns within the data set. It is important to understand that AI is not just one 
single algorithm. Instead, it is an entire machine learning system which can solve problems and suggest outcomes. Here's a simple, 
short cut explanation of how AI typically works:</br>

•	Data Collection: AI systems require a huge amount of data to learn from. This data can be collected from various sources such as databases, or the internet.</br>
•	Data Preprocessing: The collected data is processed and prepared for analysis. This can involve cleaning the data, removing noise, and organizing it in a suitable format.</br>
•	Training: AI algorithms are trained using the preprocessed data. For example, machine learning algorithms, learn from their data to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions. During the training, the algorithm adjusts its parameters based on the input data to optimize its performance.</br>
•	Decision Making: After training, the AI system can make decisions or predictions based on new data. It applies the knowledge it gained during training to analyze and interpret the new inputs.</br>
•	Feedback and Improvement: AI systems can learn and improve over time. They can get feedback on their predictions or actions and use it to enhance their models and algorithms for better performance.</br>

<h3>What is a neural network?</h3>
Neural networks are extremely complex and complicated to understand, therefor I’m going to explain the basic concept of it. 
A neural network is the rudimentary concept in artificial intelligence. It is created after the model of the human brain. It 
consists of interconnected nodes called neurons (each is like a tiny computational unit) organized into three different kinds of 
layers, which are: the input layer, hidden layers (if there are any), and the output layer. Each connection between neurons has an 
individual weight linked to it. These weights are determining the importance of the connection. In addition, each neuron has a 
bias, which is like a constant value that influences whether it is activated or not. The neurons take in inputs from the previous 
layer, multiply them by their corresponding weights, and then add the bias. After that, this combined value is passed through an 
activation function, which decides whether the neuron should be activated or not. Based on that calculated value the information 
flows forward through the network from the input layer to the output layer. The input layer receives the initial data, and the 
activations are calculated for each following layer, propagating forward until the final output is generated. But to know how to 
weight the individual connections, it first has to learn. During the learning process, the neural network adjusts its biases and 
weights to enhance its performance. This process is called training. It involves comparing the network's output to the wanted 
output, calculating the difference, and using an optimization algorithm to adapt the weights and biases so that it minimizes the 
error. When the neural network is trained, it can make predictions or classify new input data using the learned weights and biases.

<h3>What is machine learning?</h3>
Machine learning is behind chatbots, language translation apps, the shows that Netflix suggests you, and how your social media 
feeds are presented. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to 
imitate intelligent human behavior, which gives computer systems the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed to do so. 
Machine learning takes the approach of letting computers learn to program themselves through experience. Maybe you ask yourself now, 
what is the difference between machine learning and a neural network? Because technically, a neural network is a kind of machine 
learning model that is used in supervised learning. So, machine learning is pretty much the main component of artificial 
intelligence.

<h3>What influence does data have on artificial intelligence?</h3>
It plays a crucial role in artificial intelligence systems. It serves as the foundation for training, it is key for helping AI 
systems to learn effectively, validating, and improving AI models. The quality, quantity, and diversity of data directly influence 
the performance and capabilities of AI systems. Without data artificial intelligence wouldn’t be possible.

<h3>How does ChatGPT work?</h3>
Let’s clear something about ChatGPT right away: ChatGPT doesn’t understand anything you ask it, or it answers you!</br>
ChatGPT was trained on 500 billion "tokens" which allow its language models to more easily assign meaning and predict plausible 
follow-on text. Many words map to single tokens, though longer or more complex words often break down into multiple tokens. 
All the tokens came from a massive corpus of data written by humans. That includes books, articles, and other documents across 
all different topics and an unbelievable amount of content scraped from the open internet. It was allowed to crunch through the 
sum total of human knowledge.</br>
So ChatGPT takes an input and then, based on the values and weightings it gives to the different parameters (and a small amount of 
randomness), it gives you whatever it thinks best matches your question.
</p><p>
<h3>What are the limitations of ChatGPT and what to look out for when using it?</h3>
Struggles with long-form, structured content:</br>
Creating long-form content that adheres to a specific structure or narrative presents a challenge for ChatGPT. While it can 
produce coherent and grammatically correct sentences, it may falter when tasked with generating more extended, organized pieces. 
For such content, human input or alternative tools can be more effective.</br>
Difficulty comprehending context:</br>
Understanding context, especially with humor and sarcasm, is a challenge for ChatGPT. The model, while proficient at language 
processing, may struggle to capture the subtleties involved in these aspects of human communication. This can lead to inappropriate 
or irrelevant responses, as the model misunderstands the intended meaning of a prompt.</b>
Restricted knowledge base:</b>
Despite having access to vast information, ChatGPT’s knowledge isn’t unlimited. It may not be well-equipped to tackle niche topics 
or stay up to date with the latest developments in specific fields.</br>
Inaccuracy in responses:</br>
ChatGPT is an evolving AI model, and it is not immune to mistakes. It may sometimes provide incorrect information due to 
grammatical, mathematical, factual, or reasoning errors. As a user, you should cross-check the output you receive to ensure its 
correctness and credibility.</br> 
Inefficiency with multitasking:</br>
Handling multiple tasks simultaneously is another area where ChatGPT’s performance can suffer. When given several objectives to 
focus on, the model may struggle to prioritize them, leading to decreased effectiveness and accuracy. To maximize ChatGPT’s 
utility, it is best to assign a single task or objective at a time.</br>
Tendency for verbosity:</br>
ChatGPT often provides detailed answers by exploring a topic from multiple angles. While this can be helpful in some cases, it may 
also result in overly long, formal, or redundant responses. For people who are seeking simple, direct, or short answers, this 
tendency might hinder the usefulness of ChatGPT’s output.</br>
Incorrect sources:</br>
It is known that ChatGPT may give you none existing sources, because of that it is important to check if the sources are correct.
